# Data Wrangling on OpenStreetMap Data of San Diego Area

The area I chose is as follows:
https://www.openstreetmap.org/export#map=11/32.8435/-117.0607

I spent the most memorable years in San Diego, pursued my graduate school degree, started my career. It's regarded as my second hometown. The city is beautiful and diverse in all aspects. I'd like to dig deeper into this piece of map data.
